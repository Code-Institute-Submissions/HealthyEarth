## UX
### __Strategy__
The idea behind this website is to attract indivisual and groups to take part in cleaning their neighborhood and make changes
in their dietary habbits to lead a healthy and strong life. As tremendous increase in awareness now everybody wants to participate in cleaning mother earth and 
change their life style.
#### Website Goals:
* The basic goal of this Website HEALTHY WORLD, HEALTHY US! is to let people take initiative inorder to clean the Mother earth and to make small changes in their life-style and make it healthier.
* My target audiance is youth and employed people because their lifes are very busy with study and work that its hard for them to just start implimenting these changes out of their routine life.

#### User goals are:
* We all have amazing ideas to make the world green and more liveable for future generations but most of the times we find ourselves without any platform to put that amazing idea into.
* Almost everybody wants a clean environment to live or to go to fun entertainment places that are clean. 
* A healthy life-style is not a useful but a need and necessity in modern time. Realizing this fact now people want to change their life-style in terms of diet.
* Generally people want to feel good about themselves that they are contributing in making world green and just sending a donation while siting on our couch won't give that feeling. 

This website would be great in acheiving these goals mentioned above because:

* It would provide a platform for participants to put out their amazing ideas in weekly coffee and brain-storming sessions. where the ideas will be presented and/or made batter with the help of other participants.
* Helping out to make world a better/cleaner place starting with our own neighborhood can essencially create a confidenace and happiness that would go on with the participants a long way in making their day/week and life better.
* participants will be motivated to make dietary changes in their daily life-style and they would be given new inovative recepies that other participants have tried to make this coversion easy and smooth in order to mantain a healthy life style.
* Along with advantage of a clean neighborhood and self-confidenace this cleaning will provide as an exercise including walking and carring weight which would be part of a healthy life-style.
* As mentioned earlier that donating money while siting at home isn't sufficiant to provide confidence and heppiness that we are helping our community, On the other hand participating in such activities would help participants achive that feeling at it's full potential.

#### Developement and Bussiness goals:
* A website created to motivated people to help change world and themselves.
* A website created with HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap framework which is exciting and motivating to look at.
* I am as a developer happy and excited to make it a part of my work port-folio.
* In future seeing the popularity of this project i can think of turning it into an organiztion that targets people from all around the world making these changes in their lifes.

#### User Stories:
1. As a person looking to make a difference in myself and world i would want to see what is this site for which i would easily find and understand by hero image and clear information presented on front page.
2. I would like to have intuative navigation so i can surf the website easily so my website is easy to navigate with a nav-bar at top right and with clear discription of where it takes user.
3. As a new user i would like to have all the necessary information infront of me so i don't waste my time looking for what i don't need so the Website has all necessity information on front page.
4. When is see and like the webiste and it's purpose i would like to start so for that there would be a campaign for new year cleaning so the user starts with it and be part of a big team.
5. I would like to have options to sign-up either when i'm on first page reading information or on last page reading about meet-ups. To join the group there are two sign up buttons 1. on top of page on all screen sizes and one on the third page of website with the meet-ups information.
6. I would like to sign-up quick so to make the process easy the top-right button of sign up is a modal form bootstrap so there is a pop-up window that easily sign-up user.

8. I would like to contact who made the Website and took the initiative for that there would be a contact us information in footer.

### **Scope**:
This website incorporates an MVP (Minimal VIable Product) method which I considered a good idea for the following reasons:
* It brings the basic layout of the website and grants awareness to user how the website is going to look like.
* It gives me an opportunity to see my design take a beautiful shape and improve it where necessary.
* Includes relevent and defining imagery and icons to make webpage look more exciting and fullfilling.
* Testimonials of participents to boost the confidence of first time user and to give them confidence to be a part of the change.
* Relevent FAQ's so that first time or a permenant user can find any answers they are looking for which is a part of intuative website.
* Social media icons so that user can see and follow our work immediately.
* Contact information and meet-ups so user feels confertable in talking and bringing any ideas forward that they would like to work on.
### **Structure**:
I designed this website in three pages with same navigation, connect with us and footer section to show consistancy to user and so that they can move around and find signup and contact information not matter which page they are on.
All pages have difference hero image that fits perfectly with the purpose of the page. and use of icon and images enhance user experience. All pages are have different theme and user will know the theme of specific page just by looing at the hero image. In addition to that they have a cover-text that inspires them to
take part in NEW YEAR CLEAN-UP as first activity to give them a boost and make them feel good about themselves to start the new year with a fullfilling experience.
### **Skeleton**:
The website is divided into three pages first with information about the problems of dirt and garbage around in our environment and how we propose to fix it. Second with dietary changes we need to do inorder to lead a strong healthy life. and third with information about our meetups and what we do in groups. i added some more content to second page as it was looking a littel small. The Wireframes are representation of project's final look.
### **Surface**:
I wanted to make first-time user see what this website is about without reading content and i achived it by using relevent imagery to each single page to let user feel the problem and need to do something about it. The use of colors was decided inorder with the color of earth's green forest which was to remind user that this is how our environment is supposed to look like.
#### Images:
* The images are selected very carefully with relevence to each page and indivisual section providing a feeling of confidenace and excitement to user.
#### Typography:
* I used Google Fonts to explore different fonts I could use with my website and decided on "Alegreya, Roboto" and "Serif" as the back-up font. Alegreya and Roboto were my choice because of its popular use and modern look and feel.
### **Features**:
 __Navbar:__ 
 * Navbar is created in dark green color (#188832) and nav-links with white to give a clear view to user. Navbar is not fixed to let user explore the full height of website and not getting diturbed by fixed stuck navbar.

 __Home Page:__ 
 * Home page has a hero image that gives a full idea to user what this website is about and with full name of website which is self-discriptive and our goal in jumbotron gives a full sence to user. I've added a cover-text on all pages to inspire user to initiate this great work by participating in new year clean-up when most of the areas around the city will be dirty because of new-years celebration.Then 
 i have feedback section from amazing participants. After that a section with FAQ's and relevent images and then connect with us with social media responsive icons and at last the footer with contact and meetup information.

 __Healthy diet page:__
 * In second page i use almost same layout to give consistancy to user and more make them clustered with entirely different dynamics of new page. i used three columns to create awareness about healthy diet and then images containers to show some amazing vegetarian receipes.
 __Meet-up page:__
 * In this last page i added handy link to a cafe where we meet and what we do in meet-ups. 
 * In Footer page i also added link to the care with timings so that its easy for user to navitage the website.
 ### __Features Left to Implement__:
 * I would love to add a validity to the signup form, but it was not in scope of this MS project.
 * I would love to expand the website world wide but with the limited time for MS1 project its only for stockholm now.

### __Bugs and fixes:__
* My Importance section and Feedback sections were merging into each other in mobile view but on desktop they were as i wanted them to be. I searched online on youtube, StackOverFlow and W3School i checked my Css file 
to fix the bug. The videos and StackOverFlow helped me figure out the problem which was that i gave Importance Container a fixed height which was causing the merging of content.
* My cover-text was mixing with the heading and text of jumbotron in some mobile views and ipad view i added media quries to fix it but its still not fixed in a few mobile views.
* In mobile view my Importance section was centered aligned with alot of padding on right side which was not something i liked so i add no-gutters class and changed the col-10 offset-1 in small screen view to col-12.
* On the meet-up page the hero image took some time to load which was because of the size of the image was too large and causing this delay. The filesize of the downloaded image was over 3900kb so I changed for another image.
* My form was not validating. upon clicking submit button nothing was happening despite of giving it required attribute. upon checking online on [code acadmey form submit](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/html-form-validation/exercises/required) it was my silly mistake of not adding type="submit" to my button.
