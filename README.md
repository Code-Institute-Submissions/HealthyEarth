# UX
### __Website Goals__:
* The basic goal of this Website HEALTHY WORLD, HEALTHY US! is to let people take initiative inorder to clean the Mother earth and to make small changes in their life-style and make it healthier.
* My target audiance is youth and employed people because their lifes are very busy with study and work that its hard for them to just start implimenting these changes out of their routine life.

#### __User goals are__:
* We all have amazing ideas to make the world green and more liveable for future generations but most of the times we find ourselves without any platform to put that amazing idea into.
* Almost everybody wants a clean environment to live or to go to fun entertainment places that are clean. 
* A healthy life-style is not a useful but a need and necessity in modern time. Realizing this fact now people want to change their life-style in terms of diet.
* Generally people want to feel good about themselves that they are contributing in making world green and just sending a donation while siting on our couch won't give that feeling. 

This website would be great in acheiving these goals mentioned above because:

* It would provide a platform for participants to put out their amazing ideas in weekly coffee and brain-storming sessions. where the ideas will be presented and/or made batter with the help of other participants.
* Helping out to make world a better/cleaner place starting with our own neighborhood can essencially create a confidenace and happiness that would go on with the participants a long way in making their day/week and life better.
* participants will be motivated to make dietary changes in their daily life-style and they would be given new inovative recepies that other participants have tried to make this coversion easy and smooth in order to mantain a healthy life style.
* Along with advantage of a clean neighborhood and self-confidenace this cleaning will provide as an exercise including walking and carring weight which would be part of a healthy life-style.
* As mentioned earlier that donating money while siting at home isn't sufficiant to provide confidence and heppiness that we are helping our community, On the other hand participating in such activities would help participants achive that feeling at it's full potential.

### **Developement and Bussiness goals**:
* A website created to motivated people to help change world and themselves.
* A website created with HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap framework which is exciting and motivating to look at.
* I am as a developer happy and excited to make it a part of my work port-folio.
* In future seeing the popularity of this project i can think of turning it into an organiztion that targets people from all around the world making these changes in their lifes.
